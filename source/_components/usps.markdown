The `usps` platform allows one to track deliveries and inbound mail from the [US Postal Service (USPS)](https://www.usps.com/).
In addition to having a USPS account, you will need to complete the "Opt-In" process for packages by clicking "Get Started Now" on [this page](https://my.usps.com/mobileWeb/pages/intro/start.action). You must also "Opt-In" to [Informed Delivery](https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action) to see inbound mail.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Camera](#camera)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

## Prerequisites

This integration requires that a headless-capable web browser is installed on your system - either PhantomJS or Google Chrome. Preferably use Chrome if your operating system supports it, since PhantomJS is deprecated.

<div class='note warning'>
If you are using a Raspberry Pi, you must use PhantomJS.
</div>

<div class='note warning'>
Hass.io containers are based on Alpine Linux. PhantomJS is not available for Alpine Linux. Therefore it is currently not possible to use this integration on Hass.io.
</div>

### PhantomJS

Install the latest version of [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html). Ensure the executable is on your `PATH`. `phantomjs --version` should work and report the correct version. This is the default option and requires no further configuration.

<div class='note warning'>
  Don't use apt-get to install PhantomJS. This version is not compatible.
</div>

If you use the PhantomJS option, specify `driver: phantomjs` in your `usps` configuration.

### Chrome

Install Chrome 59 or greater (preferably the most recent). Install the latest [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). Ensure both executables are on your `PATH`. `google-chrome --version` and `chromedriver --version` should work and report the correct version.

OS-specific instructions:

- [Ubuntu 16](https://gist.github.com/ziadoz/3e8ab7e944d02fe872c3454d17af31a5) (Selenium server portion *not* necessary)
- [RHEL/Centos 7](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46686621)

If you use the Chrome option, specify `driver: chrome` in your `usps` configuration.

## Configuration

To enable this component, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
usps:
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

You will see two new sensors, one for packages and one for mail and a camera to rotate through images of incoming mail for the current day.

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: The username to access the MyUSPS service.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for the given username.
  required: true
  type: string
driver:
  description: Specify if you're using `phantomjs` or `chrome`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: phantomjs
name:
  description: The prefix for sensor names.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: usps
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>
The USPS sensor logs into the MyUSPS website to scrape package data. It does not use an API.
</div>

## Camera

The `usps` camera integration allows you to view the mail piece images made available through USPS via the Informed Delivery service.  You must "Opt-In" to [Informed Delivery](https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action) to see mail images. This works in concert with [USPS sensors](#sensor).

### Configuration

To customize the interval that mail images are rotated in the mail camera you can edit your `configuration.yaml` file with the following settings:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: usps
    scan_interval: 5
```

To enable this camera in your installation, set up the USPS integration first.

## Sensor

The `usps` sensor integration allows you to view statistics on incoming mail and packages made available through USPS via the Informed Delivery service.  You must "Opt-In" to [Informed Delivery](https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action) to see mail images. This works in concert with [USPS camera](#camera).

To enable this sensor in your installation, set up the USPS integration first.
