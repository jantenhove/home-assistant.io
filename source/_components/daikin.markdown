The `daikin` integration integrates Daikin air conditioning systems into Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Climate](#climate)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

## Supported hardware

- The European versions of the Wifi Controller Unit (BRP069A41, 42, 43, 45), which is powered by the [Daikin Online Controller](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.daikin.remoapp) application.
- The Australian version of the Daikin Wifi Controller Unit BRP072A42. Confirmed working on a Daikin Cora Series Reverse Cycle Split System Air Conditioner 2.5kW Cooling FTXM25QVMA with operation mode, temp, fan swing (3d, horizontal, vertical) which is powered by the [DAIKIN Mobile Controller](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/daikin-mobile-controller/id917168708?mt=8) ([Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.daikin.remoapp)) application.
- The Australian version of the Daikin Wifi Controller for **AirBase** units (BRP15B61), which is powered by the [Daikin Airbase](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.daikin.airbase) application.

## Configuration

The Daikin integration can be configured in three ways. 

- Automatically via the [discovery]({{site_root}}/components/discovery/) integration.
- Via the Home Assistant user interface where it will let you enter the IP-address of your Daikin AC.
- Or via the `configuration.yaml` file by adding the following:

```yaml
# Full manual example configuration.yaml entry
daikin:
  hosts:
    - 192.168.4.161
```

{% configuration %}

  required: false
  default: All discovered hosts
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Climate

The `daikin` climate platform integrates Daikin air conditioning systems into Home Assistant, enabling control of setting the following parameters:

- [**mode**](/components/climate#service-climateset_operation_mode) (cool, heat, dry, fan only or auto)
- [**target temperature**](/components/climate#service-climateset_temperature)
- [**fan mode**](/components/climate#service-climateset_fan_mode) (speed)
- [**swing mode**](/components/climate#service-climateset_swing_mode)
- [**turn on/off**](/components/climate#service-climateturn_on)
- [**away mode**](/components/climate#service-climateset_away_mode)

Current inside temperature is displayed.

<div class='note'>

Some models do not support setting of **fan speed** or **swing mode**.

## Sensor

The `daikin` sensor platform integrates Daikin air conditioning systems into Home Assistant, enabling displaying the following parameters:

- Inside temperature
- Outside temperature

<div class='note'>
Some models only report outside temperature when they are turned on.
</div>

## Switch

Daikin AirBase units exposes zones (typically rooms) that can be switched on/off individually.

<div class='note'>

Zones with the name `-` will be ignored, just as the AirBase application is working.
