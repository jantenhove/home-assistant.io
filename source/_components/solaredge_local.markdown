The `solaredge_local` platform uses the local API available on some SolarEdge Inverters to allow you to get details from your SolarEdge solar power setup and integrate these into your Home Assistant installation.

Only specific models support the local API. The local API is available on the SExxxxH-US models with SetApp as well as European three-phase inverters SEXXK-XXXTXBXX4 models with SetApp like SE3K-E10K, SE12.5K-SE27.6K and SE33.3K. Please check the datasheets carefully if in the section "Additional Features", sub-section "Inverter Commissioning" is present the following line "With the SetApp mobile application using built-in Wi-Fi access point for local connection".

You can check by finding the IP address of your inverter and visiting it in a browser. If it supports the local API, you'll see the SolarEdge logo and a "Commissioning" menu.

<div class='note'>
If your inveter does not support the local API, you can use the [cloud based version](/components/solaredge/) instead.

## Configuration

To use the SolarEdge sensors in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: solaredge_local
  ip_address: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
ip_address:
  description: The IP Address of your SolarEdge inverter.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: Let you overwrite the name of the device in the frontend.
  required: false
  default: SolarEdge
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Full configuration sample

A full configuration entry would look like the sample below.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: solaredge_local
    name: SolarEdge
    ip_address: 192.168.1.123
```

In case you would like to convert the values for example to kWh instead of the default Wh, you can use the [template platform](/components/sensor.template/).

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for template platform
sensors:
  platform: template
  sensors:
    solaredge_energy_this_year_template:
      value_template: '{{(states('sensor.solaredge_energy_this_year') | float / 1000) | round(2)}}'
```
{% endraw %}
