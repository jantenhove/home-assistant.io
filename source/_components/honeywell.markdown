The `honeywell` climate platform lets you control Honeywell TCC (Total Connect Comfort) climate systems from Home Assistant. It does not integrate with Honeywell TCC alarm systems.

<div class='note'>

There is some potential confusion over this integration because it is currently implemented as a combination of two _distinct_ climate systems, one being US-based, the other is EU-based.

These two regions are _not_ interchangeable, so you must be clear which applies to your climate system.

</p>

## US-based Systems

These systems are based in North America, and temperatures are usually in Fahrenheit. They would likely be HVAC systems. They always use the [somecomfort](https://github.com/kk7ds/somecomfort) client library. In this integration, this is called the `us` region.

If your system is US-based, then you can access your system via [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/](https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/) (note the `/portal/`).

## EU-based Systems

These systems are based in Europe (including the UK & Ireland), and temperatures are usually in Celsius. They would likely be heating-only systems. They always use the [evohome-client](https://github.com/watchforstock/evohome-client) client library. In this integration, this is called the `eu` region.

If your system is US-based, then you can access it via [https://international.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/](https://international.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/) (note the `international`).

The `eu` region is soon to be deprecated, and ongoing support for such systems is available via the [evohome](/components/evohome/) integration.

## Configuration

To set up this integration, first confirm your region, then add the following information to your **configuration.yaml** file (the below example is for US-based systems):

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: honeywell
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    region: us
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: Email address of an account with access the TCC website for your region.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Password for the account.
  required: true
  type: string
region:
  description: Region identifier, either 'eu' or 'us'.
  required: false
  default: eu
  type: string
away_temperature:
  description: "(*only for the EU region*) Heating setpoint when away mode is on, in degrees Celsius."
  required: false
  default: 16.0
  type: float
away_cool_temperature:
  description: "(*only for the US region*) Cooling setpoint when away mode is on, in degrees Fahrenheit."
  required: false
  default: 88
  type: integer
away_heat_temperature:
  description: "(*only for the US region*) Heating setpoint when away mode is on, in degrees Fahrenheit."
  required: false
  default: 61
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}
