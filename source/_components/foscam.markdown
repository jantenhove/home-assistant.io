The `foscam` platform allows you to watch the live stream of your [Foscam](http://www.foscam.com/) IP camera in Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To enable your Foscam IP camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: foscam
    ip: IP_ADDRESS
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}

  required: false
  default: 88

  required: false
  default: None
  type: integer

### Control Foscam PTZ (Pan/Tilt/Zoom) - Home/Away

 Foscam Webcams which support CGI Commands can be controlled by Home Assistant ([Source](http://www.ipcamcontrol.net/files/Foscam%20IPCamera%20CGI%20User%20Guide-V1.0.4.pdf)). For an example of how this can be done, see the [Foscam IP Camera Pan, Tilt, Zoom Control](/cookbook/foscam_away_mode_PTZ/) Cookbook entry.
